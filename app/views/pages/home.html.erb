    <p  class="scroll-text">Hi, I'm Joe: welcome to my portfolio!</p>
    <p class="scroll-text">Below you'll see some examples of my work as a developer.</p>
    <p class="scroll-text">These have been created in a variety of contexts: pro-bono work for
    non-profit clients; collaborative work completed as part of a full stack web
    development bootcamp, and personal projects built in the pursuit of learning
    new skills.</p>

        <p class="scroll-text">Thrive Out Loud, built for the LBTQ+ non-profit "Sean's Legacy", is a web
          application built to pair LGBTQ+ young adults with mentors from the professional
          world.</p>
        <p class="scroll-text">I implemented the onboarding flow to collect a user's data and store
          it in the database on sign-up, and oversaw front end development of
          the site in-line with UX designs.</p>
        <p class="scroll-text">I also designed a scalable model for the data in our database,
          and advised and oversaw the implementation of data-privacy best practices.</p>
        <p class="scroll-text">This was all managed over the course of two months, having inherited
          the project in an entirely new stack and without any handover or documentation.</p>

        <p class="scroll-text">Farmland is a web application that allows users to order from and
        carpool to local farms, all while tracking their CO2 savings versus
        buying produce from retail stores.</p>
        <p class="scroll-text">This was a team project conceived,
        designed and built at Le Wagon's full time web development bootcamp in
        under two weeks.</p>
        <p class="scroll-text">I was primarily responsible for nested forms which
        users could use to create orders and optionally offer carpool spaces to
        other users. I also built the carbon calculator feature.</p>
