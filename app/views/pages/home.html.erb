      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        I'm an adaptable and solutions-oriented web developer who enjoys collaborating with teammates to solve technical problems and overcome challenges.<br>
        <br>
        I retrained in Web Development at Le Wagon's nine-week full-time bootcamp, where I excelled as a quick learner and hard worker. As a final project, my team conceived, designed, built and shipped to production a web application in under two weeks which solved the dual problems of finding fresh, high quality food and tackling retail carbon emissions.<br>
        <br>
        With a background in digital communications, I bring strong skills in communication and research â€” soft skills that make me a stronger developer both in a team and individually.<br>
        <br>
        I'm currently working on personal projects while I seek work as a Web Developer, and continue to learn new skills<br>

      <p>It was an honor to work with Joe at Le Wagon Canada's Web Development Bootcamp this summer. Our collaboration peaked during our Farmland web app project, which we developed in just 7 days using Ruby on Rails.</p>
      <p>Joe isn't just one of the most talented coders I've had the pleasure of working with; he is also great at communicating and establishing human relationships in teamwork settings. His motivation and quick adaptability to new concepts and tasks, played a crucial role in our project's success.</p>
      <p>I am confident that Joe will be an invaluable asset to any workplace he chooses to join!</p>

      <p>Farmland allows users to order from and carpool to local farms, all while tracking their CO2 savings versus buying produce from retail stores. This was a team project conceived, designed and built at Le Wagon's full time web development bootcamp in under two weeks.<br>

      <p>This was an Airbnb clone which we produced in less than five working days, taking the project from scratch to a working prototype.<br>
        <br>
        It was aimed at practicing our Ruby on Rails skills and taking a project from idea to production, through design and build to finally deploying on Heroku.<br>
        <br>
        We were encouraged to pick something fun and fantastical as a theme, and thus Unicornland was born!<br>

        Features:
        <ul>
          <li>Owners can list unicorns for rent</li>
