      <h3>Who am I?</h3>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a full stack developer who loves to create things and fix problems. After becoming curious about code and wanting community and to take things further, I took a bootcamp in the summer of 2023.
        <br>
        <br>
        I love to work in a team, but am currently enjoying the freedom of working on personal projects and learning new skills while I seek full-time work.
